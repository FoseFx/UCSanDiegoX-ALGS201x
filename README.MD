# Data Structures Fundamentals
I took the [algorithms and data-structures course](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/ucsandiegox-algorithms-and-data-structures) from the UC San Diego.

Here are the results of the programming exercises of chapter one.

- [Validate a string of brackets is balanced](check_brackets.cpp)
- [Recursively calculate the height of a given tree](tree_height.cpp)
- [Network packet processing simulation](process_packages.cpp)
