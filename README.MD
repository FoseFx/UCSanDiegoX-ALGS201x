I took the [algorithms and data-structures course](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/ucsandiegox-algorithms-and-data-structures) from the UC San Diego.

Here are the results of the programming exercises.

## 01 - Data Structures Fundamentals
- [Validate a string of brackets is balanced](01%20-%20Data%20Structures%20Fundamentals/check_brackets.cpp)
- [Recursively calculate the height of a given tree](01%20-%20Data%20Structures%20Fundamentals/tree_height.cpp)
- [Network packet processing simulation](01%20-%20Data%20Structures%20Fundamentals/process_packages.cpp)
